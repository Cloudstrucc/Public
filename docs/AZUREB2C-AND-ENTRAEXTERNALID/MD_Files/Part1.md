# ALIGNMENT TO TBS CLOUD USAGE PROFILES AND CONNECTION PATTERS

This section describes AzureB2Câ€™s adherence and mapping to the TBS cloud usage profiles and connection patterns. The Government of Canada has a suite of recommendations and hard requirements for implementing cloud systems that host Protected B data or perhaps has inter-connectivity with the data centres hosting Protected B data. Azure B2C is considered a SAAS based technology and therefore, only a subset of the usage profiles and connection patterns will apply to this technology. The entire list of scenarios is outlined below, and the ones that apply to Azure B2C are highlighted below and further described in context of B2C in the following section.
|Reference | Scenario (connection pattern)| Description|
|---|---|---|
|A|GC user access to cloud-based service from GC network| A GC worker accessing a cloud-based GC service on the GC network.|
|B|GC user access to cloud-based service from Internet | A GC worker accessing a cloud-based GC service from outside the GC network over the public Internet. |
|C| External user access to cloud-based service |  A non-GC external user accessing a cloud-based GC service from outside the GC network.|
|D| Service/Application Interoperability | Service and application communications with cloud-based GC services. |
|E| Cloud Administration and Management Traffic | Management of cloud-based components and support for Network Operations Center (NOC) and Security Operations Center (SOC) activities.|
