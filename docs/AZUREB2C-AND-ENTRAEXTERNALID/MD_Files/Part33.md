# APP REGISTRATIONS

App Registrations are fundamental in AB2C as they are the primary mechanism used to connect to the service. An App Registration is generated for each client application that needs authentication to the GCCF services. The same applies to Apps that require access to API’s that are protected by AB2C. The App Registration is synonymous with an “SPN” or “Service Account” which is like a machine user that is leveraged by an application to perform authorization requests to the AB2C service. When configuring App Registrations, the Department will not allow “Implicit Flows” and therefore should always avoid selecting “ID Tokens” under the authorization flow. Applications must provide a Reply URI as a unique identifier and a “front channel logout” URL which B2C will invoke if it receives a logout request in a different browser tab to ensrue that all sessions within the users’ browser is purged. Once this information is received by the B2C administrator, the requester will receive a ClientID (unique ID that identifies the application integrating with the service – which is the app registration assigned to it), a Secret (key) or Certificate (for apps that can support this), and the tenant ID (if needed) to configure within their application’s code based (or configurations – e.g. PowerApps Portals).
