# AZURE FRONT DOOR (CDN)

Because the Department is integrating with the GOC Identity Providers via the Broker, to avoid issues such as CORS or third party cookie / session restrictions in modern browsers, it is recommended that a custom domain on Canada.ca and gc.ca is configured for Azure B2C rather than leveraging the OOB issued domain. Furthermore, TBS and SSC recommend that Departments force the use of TLS 1.2x and despite the fact that Azure B2C does support TLS 1.2x, it still supports earlier versions.  Both of these factors warrant the need to implement Azure Front Door as a Proxy/CDN in front of Azure B2C. AFD has native support for B2C and has a configuring to force TLS 1.2x flows to the service and a custom domain to it as well and block the OOB domain. For this implementation, these are the only two requirements to implement in AFD however AFD has additional features that could be leveraged in the future such as WAF (additional custom firewall policies), custom headers, and health probes. AFD is recommended as itâ€™s a PAAS and therefore will simply compliment the use of B2C while living within the same cloud usage profile and connection patterns as B2C (e.g. unlike Azure Gateway, AFD is not assigned an IP which would otherwise deem it as IAAS).
