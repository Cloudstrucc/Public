| Field Type                         | OOB Schema Column Naming Example                    | Custom Field Schema Naming Convention Example            | Description                                                                                                     | Sub‑Types / Additional Notes                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single Line of Text**      | e.g.,`firstname`, `lastname`, `name`          | e.g.,`new_ShortTextField`                              | Stores brief text values (often used for names, titles, or identifiers).                                        | **Sub‑types:** Can be formatted as plain text, email, URL, or phone number; configurable maximum length and formatting options.               |
| **Multiple Lines of Text**   | e.g.,`description`, `comments`                  | e.g.,`new_LongTextField`                               | Provides a text area for longer, multi‑line input such as detailed descriptions or notes.                      | May offer plain text vs. rich text (HTML) formatting; supports larger character limits.                                                              |
| **Option Set (Choice)**      | e.g.,`statuscode`, `preferredcontactmethodcode` | e.g.,`new_StatusOption`                                | Presents a dropdown list with a fixed set of values for single‑selection.                                      | Usually implemented as single‑select; values are defined centrally.                                                                                 |
| **Multi‑Select Option Set** | (Rarely OOB – more common in custom scenarios)     | e.g.,`new_MultiSelectField`                            | Allows users to select multiple values from a predefined list.                                                  | Useful for tagging or categorizing records with multiple applicable values.                                                                          |
| **Whole Number**             | e.g.,`numberofemployees`                          | e.g.,`new_WholeNumberField`                            | Stores integer values (no decimals). Typically used for counts, quantities, or ranking.                         | Often configured with minimum/maximum value limits.                                                                                                  |
| **Decimal Number**           | e.g.,`exchangeRate`                               | e.g.,`new_DecimalField`                                | Stores numbers with defined precision and scale for exact numeric values.                                       | Ideal for measurements or figures requiring exact decimal representation (precision and scale can be set).                                           |
| **Floating Point Number**    | e.g.,`rating` (in some scenarios)                 | e.g.,`new_FloatField`                                  | Captures approximate numeric values where exact precision isn’t critical (floating point arithmetic).          | May be used for ratings or scientific measurements; note that floating point numbers have inherent precision differences compared to decimals.       |
| **Currency**                 | e.g.,`revenue`, `budget`                        | e.g.,`new_CurrencyField`                               | Designed to store monetary values with built‑in currency formatting and conversion support.                    | Automatically manages precision and often includes metadata on currency type; formatted according to locale.                                         |
| **Date and Time**            | e.g.,`createdon`, `modifiedon`                  | e.g.,`new_DateTimeField`                               | Records dates and times. Can be configured as “date only” or “date and time” (with time zone awareness).    | Options include “user local” vs. “time zone independent” modes; critical for audit fields and event scheduling.                                  |
| **Boolean (Two Options)**    | e.g.,`isactive`, `emailoptout`                  | e.g.,`new_BooleanField`                                | Holds a binary value (Yes/No or True/False).                                                                    | Rendered as checkboxes; used for flags, toggles, or status indicators.                                                                               |
| **Lookup**                   | e.g.,`ownerid`, `parentcustomerid`              | e.g.,`new_RelatedEntityId`                             | Creates a relationship by referencing another entity record.                                                    | **Naming:** Conventionally ends with “id” (e.g., `primarycontactid`). Can be polymorphic; careful naming aids in clarity.                  |
| **Customer**                 | e.g.,`customerid`                                 | e.g.,`new_CustomerField`                               | A specialized lookup that can reference either an Account or a Contact, providing flexibility in customer data. | Often configured with additional metadata to handle both Account and Contact; ensure naming reflects its dual‑entity purpose.                       |
| **Owner**                    | e.g.,`ownerid`                                    | (Generally system managed; custom owner fields are rare) | Indicates the record owner (user or team) for security and access control.                                      | Naming is consistent across the system; typically not altered by customizations.                                                                     |
| **Unique Identifier (GUID)** | e.g.,`accountid`, `contactid`                   | (System‑managed; custom GUID fields are uncommon)       | A system‑generated globally unique identifier used as the primary key for records.                             | Not editable by users; auto‑generated by Dataverse.                                                                                                 |
| **Image / File**             | e.g.,`entityimage`                                | e.g.,`new_ImageField`                                  | Stores images or file data associated with a record (used for profile pictures, logos, etc.).                   | May include file size and format restrictions; image fields are supported natively for record thumbnails and galleries.                              |
| **Calculated Field**         | e.g.,`fullname` (computed from other fields)      | e.g.,`new_CalculatedField`                             | Computes its value dynamically based on an expression that references other fields.                             | Not physically stored in the database; recalculated when source data changes. Can be used to combine or derive new information from existing fields. |
| **Rollup Field**             | (Defined via system relationships and aggregations) | e.g.,`new_RollupField`                                 | Aggregates data from related child records (such as summing values or counting related items).                  | Calculated asynchronously; useful for summarizing data from one‑to‑many relationships (e.g., total orders for an account).                         |

## Industry Standards for Relationship and Lookup Field Naming

- ### **Relationship Naming:**

  - **Clarity and Consistency:** Relationship names should clearly describe the association between entities. A common pattern is `{PrimaryEntity}_{RelationshipName}` (for example, `account_contact` for a relationship between an account and its primary contact).
  - **Avoid Ambiguity:** Use full, descriptive names rather than abbreviations to ensure that developers and administrators can immediately understand the relationship’s purpose.
  - **Publisher Prefix:** For custom relationships, include the publisher’s prefix (e.g., `new_`) to avoid naming collisions with OOB relationships.
- ### **Lookup Field Naming:**

  - **Entity Reference:** Lookup fields should incorporate the name of the referenced entity and end with an “id” suffix (e.g., `primarycontactid`, `new_managerid`).
  - **Descriptive:** The lookup field name should convey its role within the entity. For example, if a lookup refers to the account’s primary contact, use a name that reflects that relationship.
  - **Consistency Across the Model:** Follow a standardized naming convention across all entities to simplify query writing, reporting, and integration development.
