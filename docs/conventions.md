Following the table is an expanded section on relationship and lookup naming best practices.

| Field Type                         | OOB Schema Column Naming Example                | Custom Field Naming Convention Example             | Description & Purpose                                                                                                   | Naming Standards & Case Considerations                                                                                                                                                                                   | Sub‑Types / Additional Considerations                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single Line of Text**      | `firstname`,`lastname`,`name`             | `new_firstName`or `new_shortTextField`         | Stores brief textual data such as names, titles, or identifiers.                                                        | OOB fields are typically lower-case and concatenated. Custom fields should include the publisher prefix (e.g.,`new_`) followed by a descriptive name. Many teams use camelCase (e.g.,`new_firstName`) or snake_case. | Can be configured to store plain text, email, URL, or phone numbers; length limits and format options can be set.                  |
| **Multiple Lines of Text**   | `description`,`comments`                    | `new_longTextField`                              | Provides a text area for longer, free‑form inputs like detailed descriptions or notes.                                 | Use clear, descriptive names in all lower-case for OOB. For custom fields, add the publisher prefix and choose a consistent case (camelCase or snake_case) for readability.                                              | Supports both plain text and rich text (HTML); designed for larger amounts of text.                                                |
| **Option Set (Choice)**      | `statuscode`,`preferredcontactmethodcode`   | `new_statusOption`                               | Presents a dropdown list where the user selects a single value from a predefined list.                                  | OOB names often end with “code” to indicate enumeration. Custom fields should include the publisher prefix and use a consistent case (often lower-case or camelCase) to clearly identify the field’s purpose.         | Centralized definition of options; ideal for statuses, categories, or similar single‑select scenarios.                            |
| **Multi‑Select Option Set** | (Rarely available OOB)                          | `new_multiSelectField`                           | Enables users to select multiple options from a predefined list of values.                                              | Follow similar conventions to Option Sets. Custom fields must include the publisher prefix and use a consistent naming style.                                                                                            | Useful for tagging or categorizing records with more than one applicable value.                                                    |
| **Whole Number**             | `numberofemployees`                           | `new_wholeNumberField`                           | Stores integer values with no decimals, typically for counts, quantities, or rankings.                                  | OOB fields are usually lower-case with no separators; custom fields should add the publisher prefix and use camelCase or snake_case (e.g.,`new_employeeCount`) to enhance clarity.                                     | May have configured minimum/maximum limits to ensure valid data ranges.                                                            |
| **Decimal Number**           | `exchangeRate`                                | `new_decimalField`                               | Captures numbers with defined precision and scale—ideal for exact numeric measurements.                                | Names should reflect numeric precision; OOB examples are concise, while custom fields use the publisher prefix and follow consistent casing conventions (camelCase or snake_case).                                       | Precision and scale are configurable to meet requirements (e.g., currency conversions, precise measurements).                      |
| **Floating Point Number**    | `rating`                                      | `new_floatField`                                 | Stores approximate numeric values where exact precision isn’t essential (e.g., ratings, scientific data).              | Naming should hint at an approximate or “float” value. OOB fields are generally all lower-case; custom fields include the publisher prefix and use a consistent case style.                                            | Beware of floating point precision limitations compared to decimal fields.                                                         |
| **Currency**                 | `revenue`,`budget`                          | `new_currencyField`                              | Designed for monetary values, complete with built‑in currency formatting and conversion support.                       | Use short, descriptive names. OOB fields remain lower-case, while custom fields include the publisher prefix and use a consistent case (e.g.,`new_totalRevenue`).                                                      | Handles currency formatting and locale-specific conversion automatically; precision is managed by the system.                      |
| **Date and Time**            | `createdon`,`modifiedon`                    | `new_dateTimeField`                              | Records dates and times, configurable as “date only” or “date and time” (with or without time zone awareness).      | Names should clearly indicate the temporal nature of the field. OOB fields are typically lower-case. Custom fields must include the publisher prefix and follow camelCase (e.g.,`new_eventDateTime`) for clarity.      | Options include “user local” or “time zone independent”; important for audit trails and scheduling.                            |
| **Boolean (Two Options)**    | `isactive`,`emailoptout`                    | `new_isEnabled`or `new_booleanField`           | Represents binary choices (Yes/No, True/False) for flags or toggles.                                                    | Typically, boolean fields start with “is”, “has”, or similar verbs to denote a condition. OOB fields are in lower-case; custom fields include the publisher prefix and follow the chosen casing style consistently.  | Rendered as checkboxes in the UI; ideal for status indicators and simple on/off settings.                                          |
| **Lookup**                   | `ownerid`,`parentcustomerid`                | `new_relatedEntityId`                            | Creates a relationship by referencing another entity record.                                                            | Should clearly reference the target entity and end with “id.” OOB fields are lower-case; for custom fields, include the publisher prefix and use camelCase or snake_case (e.g.,`new_primaryContactId`) for clarity.  | May be polymorphic, so precise naming helps differentiate multiple lookup fields; consider the relationship direction when naming. |
| **Customer**                 | `customerid`                                  | `new_customerField`                              | A specialized lookup that can reference either an Account or a Contact, offering flexibility for customer-related data. | Use concise names that denote its dual-reference nature. OOB naming is standardized, and custom fields must include the publisher prefix with a clear descriptive element (e.g.,`new_customerLookup`).                 | Often configured with additional metadata to support dual entity references.                                                       |
| **Owner**                    | `ownerid`                                     | (System‑managed; custom owner fields are rare)    | Indicates the record owner (user or team) for security and access control purposes.                                     | Naming is system‑defined and consistent across the platform; customizations here are uncommon.                                                                                                                          | Typically not altered by end users; managed automatically by Dataverse.                                                            |
| **Unique Identifier (GUID)** | `accountid`,`contactid`                     | (System‑managed; custom GUID fields are uncommon) | A system‑generated globally unique identifier serving as the primary key for records.                                  | Names follow the pattern of the entity name combined with “id” in lower-case. These fields are not customizable and are managed by the system.                                                                         | Auto‑generated; not editable by users.                                                                                            |
| **Image / File**             | `entityimage`                                 | `new_imageField`                                 | Stores binary data like images or files, often used for profile pictures or logos.                                      | Use simple, descriptive names. OOB fields are typically a single word; custom fields include the publisher prefix and are formatted using the chosen casing standard (camelCase or snake_case).                          | May include constraints such as file size and format; used for displaying thumbnails or galleries.                                 |
| **Calculated Field**         | `fullname`(derived from other fields)         | `new_calculatedField`                            | Dynamically computes its value based on expressions or formulas referencing other fields.                               | Naming should reflect that the field is derived (e.g., using terms like “calculated” or “derived”). OOB fields use established naming; custom fields include the publisher prefix and consistent case formatting.    | Not physically stored in the database; recalculated as source fields change.                                                       |
| **Rollup Field**             | (Defined via system relationships/aggregations) | `new_rollupField`                                | Aggregates data from related records (for example, summing values or counting related items).                           | Names should indicate an aggregative or summary purpose. Custom fields must include the publisher prefix and follow camelCase or snake_case conventions to denote their calculated nature.                               | Calculated asynchronously; often used to summarize one‑to‑many relationships (e.g., total orders per account).                   |

### Expanded Naming Best Practices for Relationships and Lookups

#### Relationship Naming

* **Clarity & Descriptiveness:**

  Relationship names should clearly indicate the nature of the association. A common convention is to combine the primary entity name with a descriptive term for the relationship (e.g., `account_contact` for an account’s primary contact).
* **Publisher Prefix for Custom Relationships:**

  For custom relationships, prepend the publisher’s unique prefix (e.g., `new_`) to avoid collisions with OOB relationships.
* **Case Consistency:**

  Use a consistent case—whether lower-case, camelCase, or snake_case—across all relationship names to ensure uniformity throughout the solution.
* **Avoid Ambiguity:**

  Choose names that precisely communicate the relationship’s purpose rather than relying on abbreviations. This enhances readability and maintainability.

#### Lookup Field Naming

* **Entity Reference in the Name:**

  Lookup field names should incorporate the name of the referenced entity and typically end with “id” (e.g., `primarycontactid` or `new_primaryContactId`).
* **Descriptive Purpose:**

  The lookup name should reflect its role (for example, differentiating between “manager” and “supervisor” if multiple lookups exist on a single entity).
* **Consistency Across the Model:**

  Whether using camelCase or snake_case, keep the naming convention consistent. OOB lookups are usually lower-case and custom fields should follow suit, starting with the publisher prefix.
* **Relationship Direction:**

  In polymorphic scenarios or when multiple lookups exist, consider including additional descriptive text to clarify the relationship (e.g., `new_parentAccountId` vs. `new_primaryAccountId`).
