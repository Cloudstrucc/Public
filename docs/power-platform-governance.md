## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive guide for implementing and operating Microsoft Power Platform at an enterprise scale within Elections Canada. It leverages the Power Platform Center of Excellence (CoE) Toolkit and established best practices for governance, tenant hygiene, and operational processes.

The Power Platform provides a suite of tools including Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, and Power Pages that enable digital transformation through low-code/no-code solutions. This guide aims to ensure that Elections Canada can effectively manage, govern, and scale the use of these tools while maintaining security, compliance, and operational efficiency.

## Power Platform CoE Toolkit Overview

The Power Platform CoE Toolkit is a set of components and tools designed to help organizations implement governance and management capabilities for Power Platform. It consists of several core modules that work together to provide a comprehensive management solution.
