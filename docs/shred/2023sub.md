This project aims to fundamentally transform how users and organizations maintain control over their data across various SaaS platforms and cloud services, introducing novel encryption techniques and blockchain-based verification systems.*

#### Project Anticipated Timeline

*This multi-year research initiative reflects the complexity and scope of developing new encryption standards and data control mechanisms. The timeline accounts for multiple phases of research, development, and testing required to validate our innovative approaches to data sovereignty.*

**Start date:** October 2020
**Completion date:** September 2025

### Technological Uncertainties:

*In pursuing this innovative approach to data sovereignty, we encountered several fundamental technological uncertainties that challenged existing paradigms in data security and control. These uncertainties stem from the complex interplay between encryption technologies, cloud platforms, and user requirements for seamless data access and control.*

A fundamental challenge in current data security models is the inability to maintain persistent control over data once it leaves a user's direct possession. While existing technologies like DocuSign and Adobe Sign implement digital signatures and encryption, they don't provide true user-controlled data sovereignty, especially after data is stored in third-party SaaS platforms' databases.

Key technological uncertainties we are addressing include:

1. **Novel Encryption Character Integration:**

   - We are investigating whether it's possible to embed a specialized algorithmic key within standard character sets that can maintain encryption properties while meeting SaaS platform validation rules
   - Uncertainty exists around how to implement this "micro encryption artifact" at the character level without disrupting standard data validation patterns or causing system compatibility issues
   - We need to determine if this encryption method can survive data transformation processes common in SaaS platforms while maintaining its integrity
2. **Decentralized Key Management:**

   - We are exploring how to implement a distributed PKI system using ION2 blockchain technology that can manage multiple sub-keys while maintaining performance
   - Uncertainty exists around scaling this system across different cloud providers (Azure, AWS, Salesforce) while maintaining consistent key synchronization
   - We need to understand how to implement key revocation that renders stored data unusable without disrupting system operations
3. **Immutable Audit Trail Implementation:**

   - Technical challenges exist in creating an algorithmically tamper-proof record of all data interactions, including keystroke-level changes
   - We are uncertain how to implement coordinated attestation between employee and employer private keys without creating performance bottlenecks
   - Need to determine how to maintain audit trail integrity across distributed systems while ensuring scalability

One challenge we encountered is that encrypted data may not meet SaaS platform validation rules. For example, an encrypted birthdate would fail a system expecting a standard date format. To solve this, we are building a shared trust model, enabling users and vendors to manage encrypted data smoothly. Vendors will also have tools to purge or relocate revoked data, respecting retention policies while allowing users to regain their data if they return to the service.

We are testing this mechanism with Azure Entra Verified ID and Microsoft Power Platform. Our goal is to enable secure, user-controlled data sharing without disrupting SaaS workflows, ensuring compatibility across platforms like Azure, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, and AWS.

We do not know whether Azure Entra Verified ID can scale across multiple cloud platforms. While it performs well in single-cloud environments, we were uncertain how to extend these workflows to hybrid or multi-cloud systems like AWS without latency or performance issues. Our goal is to ensure seamless identity management across platforms without compromising security or user experience.

We are uncertain how to synchronize key rotations across distributed environments without disrupting access. Our vault's encryption requires timely key rotations, but existing technologies struggle to rotate keys without interrupting active sessions. We need to understand why synchronization issues arise across cloud providers like Azure and AWS and how to maintain seamless access during updates.

We need to decide whether biometric authentication should replace or complement MFA. Although biometrics via Azure AD enhance security, we must determine if it should replace MFA or act as an additional factor without adding vulnerabilities or complexity.

We need to understand why encryption algorithms perform inconsistently across hybrid environments. Initial tests showed variations in speed and resource usage across Azure, AWS, and private clouds. We are investigating whether these issues stem from differences in infrastructure or APIs and how to optimize performance across all platforms to maintain consistency.

### Technological Advancements:

*Our research efforts have yielded significant breakthroughs in several key areas of data sovereignty and encryption technology. These advancements represent substantial progress in solving fundamental challenges in data control and security, while introducing novel approaches to user-controlled data management across cloud platforms.*

1. **Character-Level Encryption Breakthrough:**

   - Developed preliminary prototypes for embedding encryption artifacts within standard character sets
   - Created a novel algorithm that allows encryption properties to persist through standard data validation processes
   - Implemented test cases showing successful encryption survival through multiple data transformation cycles
2. **Enhanced Key Management System:**

   - Developed a hierarchical sub-key system that maintains granular control over data access
   - Implemented prototype browser plugin demonstrating successful integration with common SaaS platforms
   - Created notification system for real-time permission management and access control
3. **Organizational Vault Enhancements:**

   - Developed coordinated attestation system using blockchain technology for tamper-proof record keeping
   - Implemented keystroke-level tracking with encryption for comprehensive audit trails
   - Created unified viewing interface for authorized parties to access immutable records
4. **Novel Data Sovereignty Features:**

   - Implemented revocation mechanism that renders stored data unusable while maintaining database integrity
   - Developed system for managing subscription-based access with automatic permission expiration
   - Created data lifecycle management system with user-controlled retention policies

The **Digital Organization Vault** ensures **data integrity through advanced encryption models, blockchain integration, and decentralized identities**. Each time a contract, identity record, or transaction is modified, it is **re-hashed** and the vault's state is updated without altering previous records. This creates an **immutable chain of events**, tracked and stored using **ION2 blockchain technology**. This system ensures that sensitive documents and contracts are protected, with all changes securely documented and verifiable, providing a high-assurance framework for legal agreements and identity management.

A key **innovation this year was the decoupling of encryption from identity platforms** like Microsoft Entra ID. Our system allows encrypted data to remain accessible only to authorized users, regardless of the SaaS provider's infrastructure. If a user **revokes access**, the encrypted data becomes immediately unusable. This feature gives users **full control over their data footprint** without impacting the underlying SaaS system. We designed this functionality with **multi-tenant scenarios** in mind, allowing multiple clients or divisions to share infrastructure while maintaining **segregated data access** using encrypted keys tied to identity tokens.

### Future Research Directions:

*Building on our current achievements, we have identified several critical areas requiring further investigation and development. These research directions reflect both the challenges uncovered during our current work and the opportunities for additional innovation in data sovereignty and security.*

1. **Cross-Platform Integration:**

   - Need to optimize performance of character-level encryption across different platforms
   - Research required to minimize latency in blockchain-based attestation system
   - Investigation needed into scaling capabilities across multiple cloud providers
2. **Security Enhancement:**

   - Further research needed on sub-key management in distributed environments
