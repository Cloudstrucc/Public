# **Pilot Deployment Roadmap & Cost-Saving Optimization Plan**

## **1. Objectives of the Pilot**

The pilot will test and validate the **Microsoft-based call center solution** before full-scale deployment during general and by-elections. The primary goals include:

✅ **Validate Call Routing & IVR Automation**  
✅ **Assess Agent Productivity & Licensing Needs**  
✅ **Optimize Call Deflection to Digital Channels (Chat, SMS, AI)**  
✅ **Ensure Seamless Scalability for Election Events**  
✅ **Measure Costs & Identify Optimization Opportunities**

## **2. Pilot Deployment Roadmap**

This roadmap outlines a **3-month pilot** with a **small-scale agent pool (100 agents)** before scaling up.

### **📌 Phase 1: Setup & Configuration (Weeks 1-4)**

**Goal:** Deploy core call center infrastructure, train initial agents, and test system capabilities.

- **✅ Set Up Azure Communication Services (ACS)**
  - Configure **PSTN phone numbers & IVR call flows**.
  - Set up **Direct Routing for Teams integration**.

- **✅ Deploy D365 Omnichannel for Customer Service**
  - Enable **live chat, SMS, and social media integration**.
  - Configure **agent workspaces & call queue management**.

- **✅ Implement AI Chatbots & Self-Service**
  - Build **Power Virtual Agents (PVA) for FAQ automation**.
  - Train AI models on **election-related inquiries**.

- **✅ Train 100 Pilot Agents**
  - Conduct **Microsoft Teams-based training sessions**.
  - Assign **agents to different call queues (voting, registration, results, etc.)**.

### **📌 Phase 2: Live Pilot Testing (Weeks 5-8)**

**Goal:** Evaluate system performance, test AI handling, and optimize agent workflow.

- **🔄 Monitor IVR & Call Routing Performance**
  - Track **call handling efficiency and IVR response rates**.
  - Identify **bottlenecks in queue routing & agent availability**.

- **📊 Optimize AI & Self-Service Features**
  - Test **Power Virtual Agent performance** (how many inquiries it resolves).
  - Adjust chatbot **conversation flows based on live data**.

- **⚡ Scale Agent Capacity (If Needed)**
  - If demand is higher than expected, **temporarily add 50 more agents**.
  - Tune **agent schedules for peak election hours**.

- **🔍 Conduct Agent & Supervisor Feedback Sessions**
  - Gather feedback on **agent workflows, call resolution efficiency**.
  - Identify **pain points & areas for improvement**.

### **📌 Phase 3: Post-Pilot Review & Scaling Plan (Weeks 9-12)**

**Goal:** Finalize learnings, adjust licensing strategy, and prepare for election-scale deployment.

- **📌 Analyze Pilot Data (Power BI Reports)**
  - Call **volumes, wait times, agent efficiency, chatbot deflections**.
  - Breakdown of **costs vs. performance**.

- **📌 Adjust Scaling Strategy for Election Readiness**
  - Determine **exact number of agents needed for peak election days**.
  - Plan **cost-saving optimizations** (AI handling, chat-first support).

- **📌 Develop Election-Specific IVR & FAQ Updates**
  - Finalize **updated call flows, scripts, and chatbot responses**.
  - Train **additional election agents on new workflows**.

- **📌 Approve Full-Scale Deployment Plan**
  - If pilot is successful, **scale from 100 to 600 agents**.
  - Schedule **full deployment for general elections**.

## **3. Cost-Saving Optimization Plan**

The following strategies aim to **reduce call center costs** while maintaining high service quality.

### **1️⃣ AI Chatbots & IVR Call Deflection**

**🔹 Strategy:** Increase usage of **Power Virtual Agents & IVR self-service**.  
**🔹 Goal:** Reduce **live agent dependency** by **20-30%**.  
**🔹 Expected Savings:** **$10K - $25K per month**  

**📌 Implementation Steps:**

- Improve **natural language processing (NLP) in chatbots**.
- Expand **self-service FAQ capabilities in IVR**.
- Encourage **citizens to use SMS for quick inquiries**.

    C -->|Escalate| E[Live Agent]
    B -->|Complex Issue| E
```

### **2️⃣ Reduce Unnecessary Agent Usage During Off-Peak**

**🔹 Strategy:** Scale **agent licensing down to 100** outside election periods.  
**🔹 Goal:** Avoid **600-agent licensing costs year-round**.  
**🔹 Expected Savings:** **$50K+ per non-election month**  

**📌 Implementation Steps:**

- Implement **temporary licensing for election agents**.
- Monitor **call volume trends** to adjust agent schedules dynamically.

### **3️⃣ Optimize Call Routing & Transfer Logic**

**🔹 Strategy:** Reduce **agent transfers & improve first-call resolution**.  
**🔹 Goal:** Shorten **average call duration by 20%**.  
**🔹 Expected Savings:** **$5K - $10K per month**  

**📌 Implementation Steps:**

- Use **intelligent call routing** based on caller history.
- Improve **agent knowledge base access for quick responses**.
- Minimize **unnecessary call transfers**.

## **4. Final Cost Estimates After Optimization**

| **Scenario**                          | **Total Monthly Cost (Before Savings)** | **Projected Savings** | **Final Cost** |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Baseline (100 Agents, Non-Election)** | **$25,500** | **$10K - $15K** | **$10K - $15K** |
| **Peak (600 Agents, Election Months)** | **$134,500** | **$45K - $60K** | **$75K - $90K** |

## **5. Final Recommendations**

✅ **Deploy pilot program with 100 agents for 3 months.**  
✅ **Use AI chatbots & IVR deflection to reduce call volumes.**  
✅ **Scale agent licensing dynamically to prevent overpaying.**  
✅ **Optimize call routing & training to improve efficiency.**  
✅ **Use Power BI analytics to track cost vs. service impact.**  

## **6. Next Steps**

📌 **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Setup & configure ACS, Teams, D365.  
📌 **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):** Live testing, agent feedback, AI adjustments.  
📌 **Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):** Cost analysis, scaling plan, election readiness.  
📌 **Post-Pilot:** If successful, **scale to 600 agents for elections**.
