# Proposal: Microsoft Power Platform & Dynamics 365 Sales Professional Implementation Project

## For [Client Name] - Federal Government Entity

### Prepared by Cloudstrucc Inc.
--- 
# üõçÔ∏è Executive Summary

[Client Name], operating under the stringent requirements of the **Protected B classification** and governed by **Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS)** cybersecurity directives, requires a comprehensive Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solution that aligns with federal government security standards and operational requirements.

To deliver secure, compliant, and mission-critical CRM capabilities, the implementation must ensure alignment with:

* **Government of Canada Directive on Security Management** (Protected B requirements)
* **Treasury Board Cyber Security Event Management Plan**
* **ITSG-33** IT Security Risk Management framework
* **ISO/IEC 27001** and **NIST 800-171** international standards
* **Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)** handling guidelines
* **PIPEDA** privacy protection requirements
* **Cloud Security Assessment and Authorization (CSAA)** framework

This proposal outlines how Cloudstrucc will implement a **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Professional and Power Platform solution** that creates a **fully secure, Protected B-compliant CRM environment** with advanced threat protection, data loss prevention, customer-managed encryption keys, and **network isolation using Azure Private Endpoints and Virtual Network (VNET) integration**.

These enhancements ensure data sovereignty, prevent unauthorized access, and provide granular control over Microsoft 365 and Power Platform traffic through approved network pathways ‚Äî critical requirements for federal government compliance.

The end state will position [Client Name] with a secure, modern, and scalable CRM platform that maximizes existing Microsoft 365 E5 investments while ensuring comprehensive compliance with federal security regulations and seamless integration with existing JIRA on-premise infrastructure, including project/task mapping and budget module connectivity for enhanced financial visibility from lead generation through project completion.

**Important Note**: This proposal is based on high-level requirements gathered to date. Final scope and implementation details will be refined during the discovery phase to ensure all specific organizational needs are addressed.

## üß∞ Pre-Requisites and Deployment Approach

To perform the activities outlined in this proposal, the following pre-requisites and operating model must be established:

### üîë Access and Privileged Roles

Cloudstrucc will require:

* A dedicated **privileged administrative account** or membership in a **privileged role group** within Microsoft Entra ID.
* The following roles or equivalent custom RBAC assignments:

  * **Global Reader** (for assessments and baselining)
  * **Security Administrator** (for configuring Defender, alerts, Purview)
  * **Compliance Administrator** (for DLP, Sensitivity Labels, eDiscovery)
  * **Dynamics 365 Administrator**
  * **Power Platform Administrator**
  * **SharePoint Administrator** (for integrated document management)
  * **Privileged Role Administrator** (for conditional access configuration)
  * **Azure Network Contributor** (for private endpoint and VNET provisioning)
  * **Application Administrator** (for JIRA integration setup)

Access must be granted by the [Client Name] Entra administrator prior to production deployment.

### üèóÔ∏è Cloudstrucc Build & Staging Environment Model

To support structured, low-risk implementation aligned with federal change management requirements:

* Cloudstrucc will use its **own Azure subscription and Microsoft 365 tenant** for initial **build, configuration, and templating**.
* This isolated tenant will mirror [Client Name]'s Protected B compliance requirements and baseline.
* Implementation phases:

  * **Development Environment**: Initial configuration and testing in Cloudstrucc tenant
  * **Client Staging Environment**: Validation in client test tenant or sandbox
  * **Production Deployment**: Controlled rollout using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates

**Configuration artifacts will include:**

* **ARM/Bicep templates** for Azure resource provisioning
* **PowerShell scripts** for Power Platform configuration
* **Power Automate solutions** for JIRA integration
* **Compliance policy templates** for Protected B requirements

**This model ensures:**

* Minimal disruption to existing [Client Name] services
* Compliance with federal change management protocols
* Reproducible security posture across environments
* Audit trail for all configuration changes

### üîê Protected B Security Requirements

The implementation will address specific Protected B requirements:

* **Data Sovereignty**: All data remains within Canadian geographic boundaries
* **Encryption Standards**: AES-256 encryption at rest and TLS 1.3 in transit
* **Access Controls**: Multi-factor authentication and conditional access policies
* **Network Isolation**: Private endpoints and VNET integration
* **Audit Compliance**: Comprehensive logging and retention policies
* **Incident Response**: Integration with government security operations centers
