## 10. Conclusion

The combination of Dynamics 365 Customer Service/Sales with Power Platform integration represents the optimal solution for your E5-licensed client. This approach maximizes existing Microsoft investments, provides enterprise-grade security capabilities, and offers comprehensive JIRA integration options that far exceed what Atlassian's CRM solutions can provide.

The security guardrails available through Microsoft 365 E5 and Power Platform create a robust, compliant environment that addresses modern enterprise requirements while the native integration capabilities ensure seamless connectivity with existing JIRA on-premise infrastructure including budget modules.

While Atlassian's CRM solutions may appear simpler and less expensive initially, the total cost of ownership, security limitations, and feature constraints make them unsuitable for enterprise requirements, particularly given the substantial advantages already available through existing E5 licensing.
