## Executive Summary

**$2B+ Annual Savings Through Strategic Digital Transformation**

- **License Optimization**: $200M+ by fully leveraging existing E3/E5 capabilities  
- **SaaS-First Approach**: $500M+ eliminating custom development waste  
- **Security Consolidation**: $50M+ through centralized assessments  
- **Infrastructure Rightsizing**: $100M+ via SSC optimization  

**Service Delivery**: 80% faster, standardized across government

## The ArriveCAN Lesson

**From $80,000 to $60 Million - How We Failed**

- Simple app functionality achievable with **existing Power Apps**
- Built with expensive consultants instead of **citizen developers**
- No deliverable accountability or milestone framework
- 18% of invoices lacked supporting documentation

**The Solution**: Leverage existing Microsoft E3/E5 licenses we already pay for

## Massive License Underutilization

**We're Paying for Premium, Using Basic**

**Current Reality**: 30% utilization of E3/E5 capabilities  
**Government Cost**: $36–$57/user/month per license  

**Unused Capabilities We Already Own**:
- Power Apps (custom application development)
- Power Automate (workflow automation)
- Power BI (analytics and reporting)
- Advanced security and compliance tools

**Impact**: Paying consultants $1,000+/day for solutions our staff could build

## SaaS-First vs Custom Development

**End the "Time & Materials" Waste**

**Current Problem**:
- Building custom apps when SaaS solutions exist
- No standardization across 43 departments
- Predictable cost overruns and scope creep

**SaaS-First Solution**:
- **Predictable Pricing**: Fixed monthly costs, no surprises
- **Speed**: Weeks instead of years to deploy
- **Quality**: Microsoft-managed updates and security

## Security Assessment Redundancy

**Same Platform, 43 Different Reviews**

**Current Waste**:
- Each department separately assesses identical platforms
- 6–12 month cycles for pre-approved solutions
- Millions in redundant security reviews

**Central Assessment Framework**:
- Single government-wide security approval
- 30-day deployment for pre-approved platforms
- Focus reviews on data, not platform re-assessment

## Accountability Framework

**From ArriveCAN Chaos to Deliverable-Based Success**

**New Procurement Model**:
- Payment tied to **working software**, not hours logged
- 30–60–90 day milestone deliverables
- Federal employee project sponsors (not contractors)
- User acceptance testing required for payment

**SaaS Advantage**: Built-in accountability with transparent costs

## Implementation Roadmap

**Quick Wins (0–6 months)**:
- License audit and capability assessment
- Power Platform pilots for 5 simple applications
- Central security assessment repository

**Systematic Change (6–18 months)**:
- SaaS-first policy mandate
- Citizen developer training programs
- Deliverable-based contracting standards

**Full Optimization (18–36 months)**:
- Cross-department platform standardization
- Legacy system modernization
- AI-powered citizen service automation

## Risk Management

**Protecting Mission-Critical Systems**

**Legacy System Strategy**:
- Phased migration with parallel operations
- Start with non-critical applications
- Comprehensive rollback procedures
- Zero-downtime strategies using API gateways

**Business Continuity**: Maintain legacy expertise during transition

## AI & Automation Benefits

**Transform Citizen Services**

**Power Platform AI Capabilities**:
- **Chatbots**: 80% of routine inquiries automated
- **Document Processing**: 90% reduction in manual data entry
- **Predictive Analytics**: Anticipate service demand

**ROI**: 24/7 service availability, 30–40% administrative time savings

## Portfolio Governance

**Mandatory Bi-Annual Review Consortium**

**Project Approval Gateway** (>$1M projects):
- Justify why existing E3/E5 capabilities insufficient
- Demonstrate inter-departmental collaboration
- Document SaaS alternatives evaluation
- Quantify citizen service improvements

**Accountability**: Public dashboard tracking digital transformation progress

## Next Steps & Ministerial Commitment

**Immediate Actions (30 Days)**:
1. Establish comprehensive digital-first policy
2. Launch 30-day IT portfolio audit (>$500K projects)
3. Form bi-annual review governance structure
4. Select 5 departments for Power Platform pilots

**Success Metrics**:
- $2B annual savings within 24 months
- 80% faster citizen service delivery
- Zero major procurement scandals
- 90% cross-agency employee mobility improvement

## Bottom Line

**We Own the Tools – Let's Use Them**

Stop paying millions for custom solutions when we already own world-class platforms. The ArriveCAN scandal was preventable through proper license utilization and accountable procurement.

**Minister's Decision Required**: Approve digital-first mandate and portfolio governance framework to unlock $2B+ in taxpayer savings.
