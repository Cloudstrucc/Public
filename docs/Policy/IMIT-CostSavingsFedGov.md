# **EXECUTIVE BRIEFING DOCUMENT**

## Digital Transformation & IT Efficiency Strategy

**Protected A**

</div>

---

### Executive Summary 

The federal government can achieve billions in cost savings and dramatically improve service delivery by leveraging existing Microsoft E3/E5 licenses, adopting SaaS-first strategies, eliminating redundant security assessments, and implementing accountability-driven procurement practices. **Bottom Line**: We're paying for premium tools but using them at basic levels while simultaneously overpaying for custom solutions that could be built efficiently using existing platform capabilities.

---

## 1. Massive Underutilization of Existing Microsoft E3/E5 Investments

### The Opportunity

Most federal employees have E3 or E5 licenses but agencies are only using ~30% of available capabilities, while simultaneously paying consulting firms millions to build custom applications.

### Key Capabilities Not Being Leveraged

**Microsoft 365 E3 ($36/user/month) includes:**

- Power Apps: Build custom applications without coding
- Power Automate: Automate workflows and processes
- Power BI: Data analytics and reporting
- SharePoint: Document management and collaboration
- Microsoft Teams: Advanced collaboration features
- Dataverse for Teams: Database capabilities

**Microsoft 365 E5 ($57/user/month) adds:**

- Advanced security tools (Microsoft Defender suite)
- Advanced compliance and data governance (Microsoft Purview)
- AI-powered analytics
- Advanced identity management (Azure AD Premium P2)
- Power BI Pro: Enterprise analytics capabilities

### The Waste

- **ArriveCAN lesson**: A simple app that could have been built using Power Apps + Power Automate in weeks, not months, and for thousands, not millions
- Government paying consulting firms $1,000+/day to build basic CRUD applications that citizen developers could create using existing E3/E5 tools
- ArriveCAN cost ballooned from $80,000 to nearly $60 million for functionality achievable with existing licenses

---

## 2. SaaS-First Strategy vs. IaaS Custom Development

### Current State Problems

- **Time & Materials contracts with no deliverable accountability**: The case shows costs skyrocketing from $80,000 to nearly $59.5 million
- Building custom applications on Infrastructure-as-a-Service when SaaS solutions exist
- No standardization across departments leading to redundant development

### Proposed Solution: SaaS-First with Power Platform

**Predictable Pricing Model:**

- E3/E5 licenses provide known monthly costs per user
- Power Platform apps scale automatically without infrastructure management
- Reduces need for specialized infrastructure teams

**Speed to Market:**

- Power Platform applications can be built in weeks, not years
- Citizen developers can build 80% of business applications
- Pre-built templates for common government functions

**Quality & Maintainability:**

- Microsoft-managed updates and security patches
- Built-in compliance features (GCDocs integration, audit trails)
- Standardized user interface reduces training costs

---

## 3. Eliminating Redundant Security Assessments

### Current Waste

- **Same applications assessed repeatedly** across different agencies
- Each department conducting separate security reviews for identical SaaS platforms
- Federal organizations failed to follow procurement and security rules while creating bottlenecks

### Proposed Central Assessment Framework

**Single Authority Assessment:**

- Create a central "Government SaaS Security Assessment" repository
- Once Microsoft 365/Power Platform is assessed for one department, it's approved for all
- Publish standardized security baselines for common platforms

**Accelerated Onboarding:**

- Pre-approved platforms can be deployed within 30 days
- Focus security reviews on data classification, not platform re-assessment
- Eliminate 6-12 month assessment cycles for pre-approved solutions

---

## 4. SSC Data Centre Underutilization

### The Reality

- Shared Services Canada data centres are significantly underutilized
- Government continues building custom infrastructure when cloud-native solutions exist
- Operating costs remain fixed while usage is low

### Strategic Rationalization

**Hybrid Approach:**

- Migrate commodity workloads to Microsoft 365 cloud (already security-assessed)
- Retain sensitive/classified workloads in SSC facilities
- Right-size SSC infrastructure for actual classified requirements

**Cost Optimization:**

- Reduce SSC operating costs by 40-60% through rightsizing
- Eliminate redundant backup and disaster recovery infrastructure (Microsoft provides this)
- Reallocate SSC expertise to govern hybrid cloud architecture

---

## 5. Accountability Framework: From Time & Materials to Deliverable-Based

### Current Problem: The ArriveCAN Model

- 18% of invoices didn't have sufficient supporting documentation
- Contractors copied and pasted government requirements without adding value
- No clear accountability for deliverables

### Proposed: SBIPS-Style Milestone Framework

**Deliverable-Based Contracts:**

- Payment tied to working software, not hours logged
- 30-60-90 day milestone deliverables
- User acceptance testing required for payment release

**SaaS Procurement Model:**

- Fixed monthly/annual costs for SaaS platforms
- Performance metrics tied to user adoption and business outcomes
- Built-in scalability without contract amendments

**Accountability Measures:**

- Project sponsors must be federal employees (not contractors)
- Clear success criteria defined before procurement
- Regular business value assessments every 90 days

## 17. Benefits of Open Source Solutions Hosted on PaaS (Azure & AWS)

### Why PaaS-Hosted Open Source Feels Like SaaS

* **Scalability Built-In**: Deploying open source solutions (like WordPress, Discourse, or CKAN) on Azure App Services or AWS Elastic Beanstalk allows auto-scaling, monitoring, and managed patching, much like SaaS.
* **Reduced Infrastructure Overhead**: No need to manage virtual machines or patch operating systems‚ÄîPaaS handles the runtime.
* **Faster Deployment**: Pre-configured templates and container support (Docker, GitHub Actions, Azure Container Apps) reduce time-to-value.
* **Security & Compliance**: Built-in compliance certifications (SOC 2, ISO, FedRAMP) from cloud providers can be inherited.
* **Customization & Portability**: Open source projects allow deep customization and code ownership while enjoying many SaaS benefits.

### Cost Efficiency

* Lower total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to traditional IaaS or on-prem hosting.
* Use of reserved instances and serverless models can further reduce long-term costs.

---

## 18. Challenges and Considerations of the Strategy

### Operational Risks

* **Downtime Sensitivity**: Even on PaaS, open source workloads are not immune to outages. Application-level monitoring and failover are still needed.
* **Complex Migrations**: Migrating legacy or vendor-locked apps to PaaS-hosted open source platforms requires upfront architecture planning.

### Talent & Resource Constraints

* **Open Source Expertise Gaps**: While SaaS reduces complexity, PaaS-hosted open source still requires developers and DevOps with cloud and security knowledge.
* **Dependency Management**: Projects can suffer from outdated libraries or insufficient long-term community support if governance is weak.

### Procurement & Contracting Challenges

* **SBIPS Complexity**: Procuring open source-based solutions under SBIPS (Solutions-Based Informatics Professional Services) can be more complicated than SaaS:

  * Requires solution architecture and milestone-based RFPs
  * Less pricing predictability compared to SaaS subscriptions
  * Potential delays from multiple vendor handoffs and architectural disagreements

### Governance Considerations

* Establishing accountability for uptime, patching, and application support is critical when using open source platforms in mission-critical settings.
* Inter-departmental coordination is required for reuse, documentation, and shared improvements.
