# Elections Canada ‚Äì Power Platform CoE Implementation Project Plan

This document outlines the remaining activities required to complete the Power Platform Center of Excellence (CoE) implementation at Elections Canada. The CoE has been provisioned in a development environment (`coe-dev`) and will later be deployed in production (`COE`). A Power Pages site will serve as the central internal web portal for agency users to request new environments, download solution templates, submit DLP exemptions, and more.

The project is divided into two phases:

* **Finalizing Development Work** in `coe-dev`
* **Executing Production Launch** in the `COE` environment

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Note: ATOs and associated governance steps are outside the scope of this plan but are considered a prerequisite for publishing the agency-facing Power Pages portal.*
