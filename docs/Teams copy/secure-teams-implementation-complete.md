## üõ°Ô∏è **1. Microsoft Teams Security Architecture**

Microsoft Teams can be configured to provide enterprise-grade security through a layered approach that combines encryption, access controls, and secure infrastructure. This configuration is particularly crucial for organizations handling sensitive information that requires protection beyond standard deployment.

### **Key Security Features:**

1. **üîí End-to-End Encryption for Teams Meetings**Microsoft Teams supports end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for meetings, ensuring that meeting content is encrypted on the sender's device and only decrypted on the recipient's device. This prevents any intermediary, including Microsoft, from accessing the unencrypted content of sensitive meetings.
2. **üîë Customer-Managed Keys (CMK)**Organizations can configure Microsoft Teams to use CMKs, ensuring full control over encryption keys. This is achieved through integration with Azure Key Vault and Hardware Security Modules (HSM), providing a critical security layer for organizations with strict data sovereignty requirements.
3. **üîå Private Endpoints for Teams**To secure network communications, Teams traffic can be routed through Azure Private Link, establishing private endpoints that prevent data from traversing the public internet. This configuration keeps all Teams traffic within the organization's virtual network, significantly reducing the attack surface.
4. **üí¨ Secure Channels in Teams**Organizations can establish dedicated channels with enhanced security measures for sensitive communications. These secure channels can be protected with additional authentication requirements, conditional access policies, and specialized data loss prevention rules.
5. **‚ö° Power Platform Integration**
   For organizations using Power Platform applications with Teams, secure integration can be established by implementing proper authentication, authorization, and data protection controls across the integration points.

### **HSM and Key Vault: Core Security Components**

HSM and Azure Key Vault form the foundation of secure key management for Microsoft Teams, both are defined below:

- **Hardware Security Module (HSM)** is a specialized physical device that securely manages, processes, and stores cryptographic keys within a tamper-resistant environment. For Teams implementations requiring the highest security, FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or 4 compliant HSMs must be utilized.
- **Azure Key Vault** provides a cloud service interface for managing keys, secrets, and certificates. The Premium tier of Azure Key Vault offers HSM-backed protection for keys, ensuring that cryptographic operations occur within the secure boundary of certified HSMs.

Together, these components ensure that encryption keys remain protected throughout their lifecycle and are never exposed in plaintext outside the secure HSM boundary.

## üíº **2. Licensing and Infrastructure Requirements**

Implementing a secure Microsoft Teams environment requires specific licensing tiers and infrastructure components to enable the advanced security features:

**üìä Microsoft 365 E5 License** The E5 tier includes the necessary security features such as Microsoft Information Protection, Advanced Threat Protection, and compliance management capabilities. This license level is required for organizations implementing the highest security standards for Teams.
**üìà Azure Key Vault Premium** Azure Key Vault Premium tier is required for HSM-protected keys. The Premium tier provides FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated HSMs for key generation and storage, ensuring that cryptographic keys are protected by dedicated hardware.
**üóÉÔ∏è Azure Private Link** For private network connectivity, Azure Private Link enables private endpoints for Teams traffic. This service is billed based on data usage and the number of private endpoints.
**üîó Power Platform Security Add-ons**
  If integrating with Power Platform components, additional security add-ons may be required to maintain consistent security controls across the integration points.
