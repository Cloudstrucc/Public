# SUMMARY

The purpose of this document is to describe and illustrate the application lifecycle management (ALM) strategy at DEPT. The Dynamics 365 implementation at DEPT is quickly growing and new features are being added every quarter. In addition to new features, more and more line of businesses are onboarding as well. To accommodate frequent changes and optimizations to the platform to meet evolving business requirements, DEPT is embarking on an exercise to optimize their ALM process to achieve a greater level of configuration management integrity.
