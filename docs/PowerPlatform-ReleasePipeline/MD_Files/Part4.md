# Service Connections

The table below includes the service connections required for this extension. In addition to service connections, since this extension is leveraging the community version of the build tools, connecting strings must also be configured. However, the connection strings are automatically generated by other variables (e.g. the SPN – App Registrations/App User’s TenantID, URL, ClientID and Secret all of which are concatenated within the source and target connection strings for each environment. These variables, including the service connections (Target and SourceSPN-{ENV} variables are available in the Variable Group (Connection-Parameters). 

A service connection should be created for each environment that will service as a source and target environment for the integration and deployment pipelines. All connection parameters should be pre-defined in the connection parameters variable group.
