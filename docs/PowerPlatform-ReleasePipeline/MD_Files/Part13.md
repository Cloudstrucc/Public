#SUMMARY
DEPT can opt to use a combination of the two options instead of picking one. In this scenario, developers will be responsible to commit their work, indirectly through the pipeline script in DevOps, and the cadence for option 2 would be that the release manager would run the same pipeline at specific time intervals during a release cycle to prepare the artefacts for a full release to UAT and Production. If DEPT opts to leverage only a single option, Option 1 would be more beneficial as it would align better with modern ALM standards whereby developers can test their own releases and receive feedback on any potential defects associated with their development artefacts through the automated test outputs provided by the pipeline so that when its time a full release, issues like missing dependencies, bugs and mis-configurations are minimized or eliminated resulting in a more reliable deployment process.
