# continuous Integration

For the organization to achieve stability, predictability and quality of their Dataverse application deployments, the build team needs to be equipped with tools that will automate the export for solutions, configuration data, and portal data and apply version control. In addition, members of the build team need the capability to deploy new features and or bug fixes frequently to minimize the complexities associated with less frequent and very large deployments. Having the ability to continuously release changes to the Dataverse applications will allow the developer to address issues such as missing dependencies, critical bugs, and potential misconfigurations or mis-interpreted requirements which can cause issues downstream. By catching these issues early, the team can resolve these issues and re-deploy. The deployment processes in the PowerPlatform can take a significant amount of time if executed manually which can cause overall productivity issues. Therefore, by implementing a robust continuous integration framework, developers can instead rely on the DevOps Pipelines feature to automate deployments which will not only provide overall productivity gains, but will also standardize the deployment processes, provide a facility for automated testing to ensure best practices are followed, validate that the solution, data and portal artefacts can be successfully deployed based on their latest changes etc. In this section, the extension for CI is described.
