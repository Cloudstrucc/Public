#OPTION 2: INTEGRATION AUTOMATION
The organization can configure the pipeline to trigger automatically via Pull-Requests. In this scenario, pull-requests are invoked to a branch such as TEST which will automatically deploy the solutions, data files, and (or) portals using pre-defined variable values in both the variable group and run time variables. In this scenario developers will be responsible to move their solution components to the primary solutions set in the variable artefacts. The release manager will then issue a PR to the relevant branch will execute the pipeline, save the artefacts in preparation for a release to a downstream environment. The benefits of this approach include a reduction of effort associated with developers having to manually invoke pipelines. The downside will be less traceability of who made the changes and when as with this approach, changes are published by a single (or multiple) release managers for the sole purpose of deployment and generation of artefacts to deploy to downstream environments.
