#OPTION 1: DEVELOPER INVOKED INTEGRATION
Developers have the option of manually invoking a pipeline for which the developer will be supply a series of variable values in a specific sequence. Once the variables are defined, and the pipeline invoked, the extension will interpret the supplied variables and will deploy the developer’s solution(s), configuration data (from the schema), and (or) the portal configuration changes automatically. As part of this process, the extension will run the solution and portal checker API’s provided by the Dataverse build tools and will export the Dataverse resources informed by the variable(s) provided by the developer. These artefacts are stored in the DevOps project storage for future usage such as release to a downstream environment such as UAT and PROD.
