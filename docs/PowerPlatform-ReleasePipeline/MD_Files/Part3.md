# Security

Only build administrators can modify the pipeline and execute the full release pipeline. Contributors (developers) can execute the build integration pipeline. This baseline implementation also restricts any modifications to the variable group that is linked to the pipelines. Only build administrators can modify these groups. However if DEPT employs a developer environment strategy, it is recommended that the variable groups are cloned and that each developer will have access to the build integration pipeline within their own branch and these would be tied to a variable group whose source and target would reflect their developer environment and point to the consolidated dev environment.
This current version of the scripts supports OOB variable groups and variable secrets but assumes that the DevOps projects is not linked to a KeyVaults. If DEPT links the project to a KeyVaults, the variable group values will be updated to include the KeyVaults name and secret IDs instead of using “masked” secrets.
