## Combat System

### Dice Mechanics

- Use standard 6-sided dice
- Units hit on their attack/defense value or lower
- Combat is simultaneous, but special rules apply for different unit types

### Historical Combat Interactions

**Phalanx vs Cavalry:**

- Phalanx gets +1 defense vs frontal cavalry charges
- Cavalry can attempt flanking (roll 1d6, 4+ = attack phalanx from side at -1 defense)

**Companion Cavalry Charge:**

- First round: Roll attack dice twice, take higher result
- If charge succeeds, enemy must test morale (roll 1d6, 1-2 = unit retreats)

**War Elephant Terror:**

- All enemy units within same territory roll 1d6 before combat
- 1-2 = unit panics, -1 to all combat rolls this battle
- Own cavalry also affected (historical stampedes)

**Siege Warfare:**

- Fortified cities defend at +2
- Siege engines negate fortification bonus
- Cities can be starved out (costs 2 turns, defenders lose 1 unit per turn)

### Morale System

After losing 50% of units in a battle:

- **Barbarian armies:** Roll 1d6, 1-3 = remaining units retreat
- **Persian armies:** Roll 1d6, 1-2 = remaining units retreat  
- **Greek armies:** Roll 1d6, 1 = remaining units retreat
- **Macedonian armies:** Never retreat while Alexander is present

## Enhanced Macedonian Challenges

### Overextension & Supply Strain (New System)

**Distance from Macedon Penalties:**

- **8-15 territories**: No penalty
- **16-20 territories**: -1 to combat, +1 movement cost
- **21-25 territories**: -2 to combat, recruitment costs +50%
- **26+ territories**: -3 to combat, automatic attrition each turn

**The Mutiny Threshold:**

- **At 25+ territories**: Roll 1d6 each turn, 1-3 = Macedonian units refuse to advance further
- **At 30+ territories**: Roll 1d6 each turn, 1-4 = 1d3 units demand return to Macedon
- **Mutiny Effects**: Affected units move toward Macedon, cannot attack until returned

### Cultural Integration Challenges (Enhanced)

**Loyalty System (Revised):**

- **Greek territories**: Start at loyalty 4, +1 per turn if garrisoned
- **Persian territories**: Start at loyalty 2, requires 2 units to maintain

## Unit Balance & Combat Mathematics

### Combat Probability Analysis

**Phalanx vs Heavy Cavalry:**

- Phalanx: 50% hit rate + 67% defense vs cavalry = 83% effective defense
- Heavy Cavalry: 67% hit rate - phalanx bonus = 50% effective attack
- **Result:** Phalanx favored in frontal assault (historically accurate)

**Companion Cavalry Charge:**

- Normal: 83% hit rate
- With charge bonus: 97% hit rate first round
- **Historical justification:** Elite unit, decisive at Gaugamela and Granicus

**War Elephant Impact:**

- Terror effect: 33% chance to reduce enemy effectiveness by 17%
- High cost (8 Talents) balanced by powerful effect
- **Historical accuracy:** Elephants terrified horses and men unfamiliar with them

### Economic Balance

**Starting Resource Ratios:**

- Persian Empire: 3x Macedon's income (historically accurate wealth difference)
- Combined enemies: 5x Macedon's starting power (increased from 4x)
- **Balancing factors:** Macedon's military quality, Alexander's abilities, Persian internal problems

**Income Growth Rates:**

- Peaceful expansion: 10-15% per turn
- Military conquest: 20-30% per turn (unsustainable)
- **Historical parallel:** Alexander's rapid expansion created administrative challenges

---

## Campaign Scenarios

### The Granicus Campaign (Short Game - 15 turns)

**Setup:** Alexander has just crossed into Asia
**Objective:** Capture 5 Persian cities in Asia Minor
**Special Rules:** No Indian kingdoms, limited Persian resources

### The Great Conquest (Standard Game - 40 turns)  

**Setup:** Full map, all players active
**Objective:** Multiple victory conditions active
**Historical Events:** Full event deck, seasonal effects

### What If Alexander Lived? (Extended Game - 60 turns)

**Setup:** Alexander survives to age 50
**New Challenges:** Roman expansion, Carthaginian navy, Celtic migrations
**Advanced Rules:** Technology development, successor kingdoms

### The Diadochi Wars (Sequel Campaign)

**Setup:** Alexander is dead, empire fragments
**Players:** Control successor kingdoms (Ptolemies, Seleucids, Antigonids, etc.)
**Objective:** Reunify the empire or establish lasting dynasty

---

## Technology Development

**1st Century BCE Innovations:**

- **Military Engineering** (8 Talents): +1 to artillery attack
- **Naval Innovation** (10 Talents): +1 to all naval units
- **Logistics** (6 Talents): +1 movement to all units
- **Diplomacy** (4 Talents): -1 cost to all diplomatic actions

### Random Events

2. **Plague:** All armies lose 1 unit
3. **Good Harvest:** +2 Talents to all players
4. **Diplomatic Crisis:** All alliances end
5. **Technological Breakthrough:** One player gets free tech
6. **Popular Uprising:** Revolution in weakest nation

---

## Balance Verification System

### Target Metrics

- **Macedonian Victory Rate**: 40% (Â±5%)
- **Alexander Survival Rate**: 60-70%
- **Average Territories at Peak**: 22-28 for Macedon
- **Coalition Formation Rate**: 80%+ of games
- **Average Game Length**: 25-35 turns

### Red Flag Indicators

- **Macedonian victories >50%**: Resistance needs more buffs
- **Alexander survival <50%**: Mortality rate too high
- **Games ending <20 turns**: Too decisive, needs more balance
- **No coalitions forming**: Resistance coordination insufficient

---

## Historical Accuracy Notes

### Military Equipment Evolution

- **Early Game:** Bronze weapons, leather armor
- **Mid Game:** Iron weapons become standard
- **Late Game:** Macedonian innovations spread (longer sarissas, etc.)

### Cultural Integration

The game models Alexander's policy dilemmas:

- **Pure Macedonian:** Maintains unit quality but limits recruitment
- **Mixed Forces:** Allows local recruitment but may cause friction
- **Going Native:** Gains local support but alienates Macedonians

### Technological Advantages

**Macedonian Innovations:**

- **Sarissa Phalanx:** 18-foot spears vs 8-foot Greek spears
- **Combined Arms:** Infantry-cavalry coordination
- **Siege Craft:** Torsion artillery, advanced engineering

**Persian Advantages:**

- **Numbers:** Larger armies, more resources
- **Experience:** Professional military tradition
- **Intelligence:** Extensive spy networks

### The Enhanced Challenge Model

This revision models the real challenges Alexander would have faced:

1. **Supply Line Vulnerabilities**: Armies couldn't maintain effectiveness across vast distances
2. **Cultural Resistance**: Each conquest made the next harder due to local opposition
3. **Macedonian Manpower**: Limited population couldn't sustain endless expansion
4. **Coalition Formation**: Success would have triggered unified resistance
5. **Succession Issues**: Alexander's death would have ended unified expansion

### Alternative History Elements

The enhanced resistance capabilities represent what could have happened:

- **Persian resurgence** under competent leadership
- **Indian unity** against foreign invasion  
- **Greek democratic revival** against Macedonian imperialism
- **Egyptian independence** movements
