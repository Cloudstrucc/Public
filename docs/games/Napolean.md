---

## Balance & Strategy

### Balance Verification Metrics

#### Target Performance Indicators
- **French Victory Rate**: 35% (±5%)
- **Average Game Length**: 25-35 turns
- **Coalition Formation**: Should occur by turn 8-12
- **Economic Balance**: French peak income should not exceed 45 IPCs

#### Red Flag Indicators
- French wins >45% or <25% - needs rebalancing
- Games ending before turn 20 - too decisive
- Coalition never forms - French expansion too easy
- British blockade ineffective <40% - naval power insufficient

### Starting Resources (Balanced)
- **$5000 starting capital**
- **1 Lieutenant, 2 Soldiers, 1 Thug**
- **1 home territory (safe house included)**
- **2 corruption points**

### Economic Scaling
- Early game: Focus on low-risk numbers and protection
- Mid game: Expand into bootlegging and gambling
- Late game: Political corruption and territory wars

### Risk vs Reward
- High-income operations generate more heat
- Corruption reduces heat but costs money
- Territory expansion increases income but creates conflict

---

## Advanced Strategic Elements

### Loyalty System
- Units can defect if family loses prestige
- **High Morale:** Win battles, pay bonuses
- **Low Morale:** Lose battles, miss payments
- **Defection:** Unit joins strongest rival family

### Designer Notes

#### Balance Philosophy
This revision implements **escalating difficulty** for France, where early success creates mounting challenges:
1. **Coalition Formation**: Success triggers stronger opposition
2. **Supply Strain**: Expansion creates logistical vulnerabilities  
3. **Economic Pressure**: British naval power scales with French expansion
4. **Popular Resistance**: Occupied territories become liabilities

#### Historical Authenticity
The balance changes reflect real challenges Napoleon faced:
- **Coalition Wars**: Multiple enemies coordinating against France
- **Continental System**: Economic warfare with limited effectiveness
- **Overextension**: Supply lines stretching across Europe
- **British Naval Supremacy**: Blockades crippling French economy

The game now better models the historical reality where French tactical brilliance faced insurmountable strategic challenges.
