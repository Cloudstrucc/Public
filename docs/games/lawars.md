## Balance & Strategy

### Starting Positions
**Territorial Balance:**
- Each gang starts with 2-3 neighborhoods
- 6-9 territories remain neutral at start
- Key territories (Long Beach Blvd, Rosecrans) are contested

**Resource Balance:**
- Crips start with most cash (drug trade advantage)
- Bloods have territorial advantage (more starting areas)
- Mexican Mafia has equipment advantage (weapon connections)
- LAPD has federal support and legal authority

### Faction Strategies
**Bloods:** Focus on territorial expansion, build neighborhood loyalty
**Crips:** Maximize drug operations, use mobility for hit-and-run
**Mexican Mafia:** Control key corridors, leverage weapon superiority
**LAPD:** Balance community trust with effective enforcement

## Designer Notes - LAPD Enhancement Rationale

### Competitive Balance Philosophy
The enhanced LAPD represents a fully competitive faction through:

1. **Multiple Victory Paths**: Can win through law enforcement, economics, or community building
2. **Escalation Capability**: Federal resources provide power scaling
3. **Unique Mechanics**: Asset forfeiture and intelligence gathering create distinct gameplay
4. **Balanced Vulnerabilities**: Corruption and community trust create meaningful choices

### Historical Authenticity
Enhanced LAPD capabilities reflect real 1990s law enforcement:
- **Federal Task Forces**: Actual multi-agency cooperation against gangs
- **Asset Forfeiture**: Major revenue source for police departments
- **Community Policing**: Emerging strategy for gang suppression
- **Intelligence Operations**: Surveillance technology and informant networks

### Strategic Depth
LAPD players must balance:
- **Trust vs Effectiveness**: Community relations vs aggressive policing
- **Federal vs Local**: Outside resources vs community control
- **Reactive vs Proactive**: Responding to crime vs preventing it
- **Legal vs Extra-Legal**: Proper procedures vs expedient solutions

This creates a competitive, authentic, and strategically rich law enforcement faction that can hold its own against the three gang factions while maintaining the serious themes and realistic consequences of urban conflict.
