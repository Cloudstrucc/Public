# Production ARM Templates

This directory should contain your production ARM templates.
Copy and modify the sandbox templates from ../sandbox-arm/ as needed for production.

Remember to:
- Use appropriate VM sizes for production workloads
- Configure proper networking and security groups
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Use Azure Key Vault for secrets management
