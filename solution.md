# Event Management System Modernization Proposal for Harbour Trust

## The Objective

Our proposal aims to modernize the Harbour Trust's event management system, addressing the need for enhanced booking, ticketing, and venue management as outlined in the client's RFP. We plan to implement a comprehensive M365, Power Platform, and Azure enterprise solution, complemented by a robust knowledge transfer process—including detailed documentation, training, and support portal access—and a dedicated Service Level Agreement with Microsoft and Our Company to ensure ongoing, reliable support.

- Modernization of the Harbour Trust's Event Management System
- M365, Power Platform and Azure Enterprise Implementation to support the modernization
- Knowledge Transfer: documentation, training, and support portal access
- Service Level Agreement Support with Microsoft and Vendor

## The Solution

The proposed system comprises a Dynamics 365 Sales implementation with an event management module in the organization's Power Platform subscription, which is part of the M365 product family and is considered a "SaaS" technology. This implementation also includes the "Events Management accelerator" for Power Platform. A Dynamics 365 accelerator takes the unified data approach of the Power Platform a step further by expediting the development of vertical solutions that use industry-specific common data models with business logic integration.

Industry accelerators are foundational components within Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365 that enable solution providers such as Our Company to quickly build industry vertical solutions, in this case, an event management specific vertical. The accelerators extend Common Data Model to include new entities to support a data schema for concepts within the event management industry. This enables customers and partners to easily build and customize industry-specific applications that can use data across Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, and Azure.

This technology also ships with Power Pages technology that integrates natively with Dynamics within the Power Platform, allowing users (and external portal users) to manage event bookings, venue reservations, and ticketing in a more efficient and secure manner. Furthermore, this system has an API-driven architecture whereby the platform can interface with and read data, thus aligning with the organization's overall digital strategy and cloud adoption by implementing this product which would allow for companion apps and other systems to integrate with it easily (both ways).

By leveraging this technology, particularly a SaaS technology that has been assessed by various governments across the world as meeting enterprise ISO security standards and performance standards, the complexities associated with administering a custom implementation or infrastructure are now abstracted, thus simplifying the implementation and assuring a higher level of security due to the fact that operators cannot interfere with the backend infrastructure and encryption is handled end-to-end both in transit and at rest using AES and RSA. The client can choose to own its own encryption keys, thus ensuring that its data is private and cannot be decrypted by the supplier.

Moreover, this technology fits within the realm of Active Directory (Azure Entra), thus the client does not need to roll out its own authentication system or implement a new one, but rather allow its existing employees and user base to leverage their current credentials when using Microsoft 365. For external-facing portals for outside stakeholders, since Entra External ID is leveraged (for OAuth 2.0/OIDC SSO), the client can opt to leverage its own identity provider services (SAML and/or OIDC) or simply leverage the out-of-the-box authentication.

Our solution also supports the creation of white-label portals, allowing for vendor-managed bookings while maintaining a consistent brand experience.

### Architecture Overview

In summary, our technical approach leverages the Power Platform's suite of tools to support digital transformation initiatives such as the modernization of the Harbour Trust's Event Management System through a Software as a Service (SaaS) model. This model ensures a predictable cost structure and mitigates the uncertainties typically associated with traditional infrastructure management. By incorporating prebuilt CRM applications with Power Pages and Power Apps, we facilitate the rapid implementation of employee-customer-centric services, streamline internal data and business processes, and enhance user engagement and satisfaction.

Furthermore, our use of Power Pages enables the Harbour Trust to quickly establish a robust online presence for event bookings and efficient backend administration services. The integration of a secure payment gateway ensures smooth and compliant financial transactions for event bookings and ticket purchases.

## Extended Solution Details

### Mobile Accessibility

Our solution prioritizes mobile accessibility to ensure that users can interact with the event management system seamlessly across all devices. We achieve this through two primary approaches:

1. **Responsive Design**: All Power Pages and Power Apps interfaces are built with responsive design principles, ensuring that the user interface adapts fluidly to different screen sizes and orientations. This approach provides a consistent experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones without the need for separate mobile applications.
2. **Native Mobile App Option**: For scenarios requiring enhanced mobile functionality or offline capabilities, we offer the option to develop a native mobile application using Power Apps. This app can leverage device-specific features like camera integration for ticket scanning or push notifications for event reminders, providing a more integrated mobile experience.

### Accessibility Compliance

Our solution is designed to meet international accessibility standards, including Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA compliance. We adhere to the Web Experience Toolkit (WET) principles, ensuring that the event management system is accessible to users with diverse abilities. Key features include:

- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast compliance
- Alt text for images
- Consistent and clear navigation

## Event Management Accelerator Details

The event management accelerator helps improve resource allocation for all elements of an enterprise event management system. This accelerator would be tailored to meet every technical requirement described in the request while serving as a springboard system used by the event management industry across the Dynamics community who leverages the Power Platform. This accelerator allows event management organizations to manage information and holistically visualize information, in turn improving decision-making. It enhances engagement for all stakeholders, including event organizers, venue managers, and attendees.

The accelerator helps to springboard digital transformation with better use of event management data in three ways:

- Connecting disparate systems to a single view of event and customer data
- Creating more personal and more effective engagement with event attendees
- Managing venues and resources in a unified environment

### Custom Tables (Example)
